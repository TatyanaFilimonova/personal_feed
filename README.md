# personal_feed
Original "personal feed" was refactored using aiohttp, aiohttp_jinja2, asyncio, asyncfile

app.py - http server refactored with aiohttp and jinja2

async_logic.py - requesting and parsing data from the web APIs using aiohttp and asyncio

db.py - DB interaction using asyncio and aiofiles

DISCLAIMER: I only tested the vitality of code, didn't compare the efficiency with original "personal feed".
I couldn't measure it cause internet connection here, on the island in Adriatic sea, is very unstaible and really slooooooow. I will be appretiate if you would do test and share the results. Thanks!

QUESTION/PROBLEM: Not yet
